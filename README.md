# Calculator

An online calculator that performs all the basic functionalities of a normal calculator on your phone.

User can input two ways either by clicking on the buttons or typing the numbers.

This application was built using html,css,js and works both on chrome and firefox.

The interface was chosen to look like the old gameboy I used own back in elemntary school.
